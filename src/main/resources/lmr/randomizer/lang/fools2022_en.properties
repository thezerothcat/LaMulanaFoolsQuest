Mail1.Title=The red light
Mail1.Text=No, not that red light! I'm talking about tablets! The ones you haven't read yet have a mysterious glow around them.\nNobody knows exactly how it works, but if you see one that's glowing, be sure to read it.\n\nAnd pay attention to the colors used by your translation software! The software uses different colors to indicate certain types of meanings, but that's probably old news for an experienced archaeologist like you. Hehehe.

Mail4.Title=It's fairy time!
Mail4.Text=It's me.\nIf you're thinking of bringing combat fairies into battle, you should know that they'll only hang around for 2 minutes, and they won't help you again for 5 minutes after you've touched one of those fairy lights.\nDon't go camping their spawn points, either! You gotta walk away and give them a bit of a break if you want them to keep helping you.\nNow if you wanna speed things up, there's supposed to be some kinda software that cuts the delay in half, so you can get another fairy to help you almost immediately.
Mail5.Title=Look ma, no hands!

Mail17.Title=The Mother's wish
Mail17.Text=The guardians may still be alive, but it looks like that still wasn't enough to grant the Mother's wish.\n\nMulbruk will be disappointed; it seems her father told her stories of a pure-hearted hero who succeeded where all others failed. Maybe they were just stories after all.
Mail18.Title=The pacifist
Mail18.Text=Were you hoping to grant the Mother's wish? I don't know if that's even possible. Mulbruk said she heard that "only pure lads can make the {COLOR=BLUE}secret of life{COLOR=200-200-200} come to light" but you seem pretty pure to me.\n\nThen again, killing isn't the only thing you could do wrong. There's other stuff too, like cheating or theft. Your father was going on about not harming the ruins, too.\n\nAnyway, it's too late now. Thanks to you, the Mother is defeated and won't be destroying the eighth children.
Mail19.Title=Thief!
